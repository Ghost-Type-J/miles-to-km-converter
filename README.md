# miles-to-km-converter

Working with a GUI. 

Python's in-built module tkinter was used to make a very simple program that converts a mile result to kilometres. First time working with 
buttons and labels in python paying attention to styling, padding and layouts. I realise using HTML and CSS would probably achieve a better a result for styling.
